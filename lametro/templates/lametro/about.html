        <h3>What is {{ CITY_COUNCIL_NAME }}, and how does it work?</h3>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.metro.net/" target="_blank">Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority</a>, or Metro as it is commonly known, was created by the State of California to set policy, coordinate, plan, fund, build, and operate transit services and transportation programs throughout Los Angeles County.  It supports the transportation improvement programs of the 88 cities and 16 municipal transit operators in Los Angeles County, as well as LA's paratransit provider, ASI, and its regional commuter rail service provider, Metrolink.</p>

        <p>The <a href="{% url 'lametro:council_members' %}">Board of Directors</a> is the governing body of Metro, with representation from the City of Los Angeles, the County of Los Angeles, the other incorporated cities and unincorporated areas in Los Angeles County, and an ex-oficio member representing the Governor. Each Metro Board Chair serves a one year term, from July 1st to June 30th, and rotates annually between the Mayor of Los Angeles, a member of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, and one of the City Selection Committee Members. The full Board typically meets once a month to review presented budgets, contracts, policies and programs, and make decisions about what to adopt, fund and build.
        </p>

        <h4>Types of board reports</h4>
        <p>Below are the categories of Metro Board report activity:</p>
