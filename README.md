## Some context: a high level overview

The [councilmatic family](https://www.councilmatic.org/) is a set of web apps for keeping tabs on local city councils. This template is for creating a councilmatic app for a new city.

Councilmatic started as a Code for America project by Mjumbe Poe, for the city of Philadelphia. DataMade then implemented councilmatic in New York City (in partnership with the Participatory Politics Foundation) & Chicago (in partnership with the Sunlight foundation).

NYC Councilmatic & Chicago Councilmatic are built on `django-councilmatic` (a django app with core functionality that is common across all cities) & open civic data (a data standard for describing people, organizations, events and bills). Using a data standard & abstracting out the core functionality ultimately makes councilmatic much easier to re-deploy. This template is for building a councilmatic app on top of `django-councilmatic` & the OCD API - analogous to NYC Councimatic & Chicago Councilmatic.

To use this template, you'll need to have your city's data in the open civic data api. :speech_balloon:

## Quick start guide

NOTE: This is not a comprehensive overview of how to customize councilmatic :speech_balloon: or how to deploy a live site :speech_balloon: - only a guide to getting an app set up locally for development.

1. **fork this code**
  :speech_balloon:

2. **install stuff**
  :speech_balloon:

3. **update city-specific settings**
  - set your `OCD_JURISDICTION_ID`.
    you can find the jurisdiction ids at http://ocd.datamade.us/jurisdictions/
  - set either `OCD_CITY_COUNCIL_ID` or `OCD_CITY_COUNCIL_NAME` - this identifies your city council
    `OCD_CITY_COUNCIL_ID` will take precedence over `OCD_CITY_COUNCIL_NAME`, but it may make more sense to set `OCD_CITY_COUNCIL_NAME` if your OCD IDs aren't persistent. You can find the name and id of your city council at http://ocd.datamade.us/organizations/?jurisdiction_id=YOUR_JURISDICTION_ID

4. **update deployment settings**

5. **Set up your database**

Some of your models may require customization, but if you do not want to add custom models, then you may skip this step.

Override a model by creating a subclass of the original database model.

```Python
class LAMetroBill(Bill):

  class Meta:
    proxy = True

```

Then, add custom property methods. Here are a few to consider.

**inferred_status**

This method belongs to the Bill model. It identifies the status of the legislation, as in the case of LA Metro: Approved, Adopted, Active, or Withdrawn. If you update this method, then you also need to rebuild the search index, by running:

```
python manage.py rebuild_index
```

6. **import data**
  :speech_balloon:

7. **run the app!**
