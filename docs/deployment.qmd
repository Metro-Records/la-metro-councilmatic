DataMade hosts a [staging version](https://la-metro-councilmatic-staging.herokuapp.com/) and [production version](https://boardagendas.metro.net/) of Metro Councilmatic.

Both sites - as well as review apps for active PRs - can be found in the [corresponding Heroku pipeline](https://dashboard.heroku.com/pipelines/d77360c3-dcda-43d4-990e-b898b51ba37d/). Metro developers should be able to shell into these servers, (e.g., [for executing management commands](./commands.qmd)). If you cannot, then talk to your friendly DataMade devops team.

### Patterns and practices

Triggering a Metro deployment follows the typical DataMade pattern: merging or pushing to `main` deploys to the staging site, and pushing changes from `main` to `deploy` deploys to the production site.

The Metro deployment script runs a few steps for the production and staging environments - but not the review apps.
It will apply any new migrations, create any missing cache tables, load in shapes of districts, and clear the site-wide cache.

These steps are not run for review apps because those use the staging environment's database. This is a deviation from most of DataMade's other Heroku pipelines.
This gives us access to review apps without having to run lengthy scrapes each time we'd like to test a change of any size!
However, this does also mean that any PRs that include a modification to the database will need to be tested locally instead of on those apps.

### Working in Heroku

At times, we'll need to shell directly into these deployed environments to investigate or manipulate the data within.
Luckily, heroku provides us with a couple options for how to interact with them - the console on the site and the CLI.

#### Using the Site Console
To shell into the environment using the site console, click the Run Console link:

And then enter your command as normal. In this case, we're running `python manage.py shell`:

#### Using the CLI
To shell in using your terminal, first make sure the [Heroku CLI is installed](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#install-the-heroku-cli)
then run the following commands, replacing `<ENVIRONMENT_NAME>` with your chosen environment
(`la-metro-councilmatic-staging` for staging, and `la-metro-councilmatic-prod` for production).

```bash
>>> heroku login
heroku: Press any key to open up the browser to login or q to exit:
