Welcome to the documentation for LA Metro Councilmatic!
Here, youâ€™ll find information about the Metro data pipeline, debugging, and other best practices for DataMade developers.

## Contents
- [Debugging Data Issues](debugging.qmd)
- [Commands to Know](commands.qmd)
- [Deployment Practices and Patterns](deployment.qmd)
- [Glossary](glossary.qmd)

## What does this do?
The Metro Board Reports site monitors all things related to the Metro Board of Directors:

- the board reports introduced and passed
- its various committees and the meetings they hold
- the board members themselves

This site ultimately encourages greater public dialogue and increased awareness about transportation issues in LA County.
